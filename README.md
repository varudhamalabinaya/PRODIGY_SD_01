# PRODIGY_SD_01 – Temperature Conversion Program

This repository contains **Task 1** of my **Software Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**.

##  About the Task 
In this task, I created a Java program that converts temperatures between  
**Celsius (C)**, **Fahrenheit (F)**, and **Kelvin (K)**.

The user enters:
- A temperature value  
- The unit (C/F/K)

The program then converts the temperature into the **other two units** and displays the results.

##  What I Did 
- Took user input using Java's `Scanner` class  
- Read temperature as `double`  
- Took the unit as a character (`C`, `F`, or `K`)  
- Used `if-else` conditions to check the unit  
- Applied correct temperature conversion formulas  
- Displayed the converted values to the user  
- Handled invalid unit inputs  

## 🔢 Example Output
If user enters:
the temprature and the unit 
after these 2 you need to enter what you need to convert like whether to **Celsius (C)**, **Fahrenheit (F)**, and **Kelvin (K)** like this .
the output will give you the answer of the converted unit other than you entered .
